Step-by-Step Instructions using .m file (requires Matlab installation):
1. Install MATLAB software
2. Download 'DNA_Striker_Version_1.m' from https://github.com/mcanver/DNA-Striker
3. Create a bed file for the regions to be analyzed.
Note: If using a three-column bed file, adjust "three_column_bed" parameter to "1" and "four_column_bed" parameter to "0". If using a four-column bed file, adjust "four_column_bed" parameter to "1" and "three_column_bed" parameter to "0". 
4. In order to ensure that all sgRNA within a region are obtained, alter the starting coordinate by subtracting the sgRNA length and the ending coordinate by adding the sgRNA length. This ensures inclusive of guides that cut within the regions of interest but the full sgRNA sequence runs beyond the region of interest.
Example: start coordinate: 135431355, end coordinate: 135431756. If sgRNA length is 20 base pairs, the new coordinates to be used for analysis are start coordinate 135431335 and end coordinate 135431776.
5. Obtain the genome DNA sequences for each of the regions in the bed file in step (3). This can be easily accomplished using online tools such as Project Galaxy [Reference 1]
Note: Project Galaxy may require subtracting one base pair from the starting coordinate to get the correct sequence. Therefore, the start coordinate 135431335 should be replaced with start coordinate 135431334 when retrieving the genomic DNA sequence (however, the start coordinate 135431335 coordinate should be used within DNA Striker)
6. Ensure that the fasta file with genomic DNA sequences and the bed file with the altered coordinates are in the same folder as the 'DNA_Striker_Version_1.m' file
7. Update the 'DNA_Striker_Variables.txt' to reflect your choice for all customizable parameters (see descriptions below)
8. Run program by clicking "Run"

Step-by-Step Instructions using .exe file (requires Matlab Runtime installation - does NOT require installation of Matlab):
1. Install MATLAB Runtime software
2. Download 'DNA_Striker_Version_1.m' from https://github.com/mcanver/DNA-Striker
3. Create a bed file for the regions to be analyzed.

Haplotype Analysis:
If you want to include haplotype analysis, download haplotype VCF file from the 1000 Genomes Project using the following link (ensure VCF file is in the same folder as the 'DNA_Striker_Version_1.m'):
If http://browser.1000genomes.org/Homo_sapiens/UserData/SelectSlice?db=core
- Be sure to change "perform_haplotype_analysis" to "1" and "perform_variant_analysis" to "0"
- Enter VCF filename in a text file without VCF extension (each VCF filename on a separate line). Enter filename "list_of_variants" parameter.  

Whole Genome Sequencing or Custom Variant Analysis:
If you want to include whole genome sequencing or custom list of variants, ensure VCF file is in the same folder as 'DNA_Striker_Version_1.m'
- Be sure to change "perform_variant_analysis" to "1" and "perform_haplotype_analysis" to "0"
- Enter VCF filename in a text file without VCF extension (each VCF filename on a separate line). Enter filename "list_of_variants" parameter.  

Test example files to run with DNA Striker (available on https://github.com/mcanver/DNA-Striker):
- filename.fasta
- filename.bed 
- VCF_filenames.txt
- Haplotype_VCF_1.vcf
- Haplotype_VCF_2.vcf
- Haplotype_VCF_3.vcf
